## Exercise I

a)


b)


c)

## Exercise II


Suppose that you have an n-story building and plenty of eggs. Suppose also that an egg gets broken if it is thrown off floor f or higher, and doesn't get broken if dropped off a floor less than floor f. Devise a strategy to determine the value of f such that the number of dropped + broken eggs is minimized.

Write out your proposed algorithm in plain English or pseudocode AND give the runtime complexity of your solution.

Building is pre-sorted
1  ok 
2  ok 
3 f get broken
4 get broken
5 get broken
6 get broken 

Need to find the middle point,  so a binary search would work (Ologn)
